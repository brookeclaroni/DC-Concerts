# DC Concerts
## CSCI 4237 - Software Design: Handheld Devices - Project 2 - BYOI
I developed this Android app using Kotlin & XML in Android Studio.  I encorporated Firebase Authorization and two RESTful APIs (Spotify & Ticketmaster) to aggregate a recycler view list of upcoming concerts in Washington DC.  Each concert listed displays details of concert name, artist name, venue, date, link to purchase tickets, and the artist's 3 most popular Spotify songs.  A user can star the the concerts they are interested in to save their preferences to their device.
